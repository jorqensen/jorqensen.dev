# It appears you're using Safari

Thanks for visiting my site! Unfortunately, there seems to be a weird bug where my image extends to 100% of it's source height, instead of 100% of the container height.

## "Why don't you just fix it?"

Because in order to properly fix it, I'd have to debug the error in Safari. However, as I went to download it on my Windows machine I was hit by [this article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204416).

> Apple no longer offers Safari updates for Windows. Safari 5.1.7 for Windows was the last version made for Windows, and it is now outdated.
